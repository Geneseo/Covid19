# Covid19_ Sentiment Analysis



# COVID-19-TweetIDs 
The repository contains an ongoing collection of tweets IDs associated with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), which commenced on January 28, 2020. We used the Twitterâ€™s search API to gather historical Tweets from the preceding 7 days, leading to the first Tweets in our dataset dating back to January 21, 2020.
The data is available at * [github](https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs#covid-19-tweetids)
